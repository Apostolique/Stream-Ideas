# Stream-Ideas
You want to see me code something? Suggest it!

Here is how to suggest something: https://github.com/Apostolique/Stream-Ideas/issues

Create a new issue and write what you want.

Ideas should preferably be short projects. Usually those are called weekend projects where you limit yourself to a single weekend session of working on that project.

The goal of each project will be for me to try to solve them while trying my best to talk about what goes on in my mind.
